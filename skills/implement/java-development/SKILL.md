# Java Development

## When to use
Any Java/Spring implementation task.

## Procedure
1. Read the `instructions/java` rules from the bundle.
2. Respect the codebase patterns (reactive chains, DTO records, validation, error mapping).
3. API changes: additive only unless the compatibility report allows otherwise.
4. Add tests: unit for rules, slice tests for wiring, contract tests for API consumers.
5. Verify SpotBugs/Checkstyle-class feedback locally when available.

## Output contract
Code and tests passing the repository build; no unregistered `TODO(INTERNAL)` added.
